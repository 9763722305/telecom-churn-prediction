##Telecom Customer Churn Prediction:

A machine learning project built using Apache Spark MLlib and Databricks, designed to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. This project demonstrates scalable data pipelines, hands-on feature engineering, model building, and actionable business insights to help telecom companies reduce churn and boost retention.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by telecom providers today. Predicting which customers are at risk of leaving enables proactive retention strategies that directly impact business revenue.

In this project, we:

Processed large-scale customer data using Apache Spark.

Built multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and One-vs-Rest classifiers.

Evaluated and optimized models to improve prediction accuracy.

Visualized results using Databricks Notebooks for better business understanding.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Apache Spark (MLlib)

Databricks Community Edition

SparkSQL & DataFrames

Python / Scala (depending on implementation)

Jupyter / Databricks Notebooks
